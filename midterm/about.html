		<h2>About Us</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Our specialized production techniques allow us to make a mask with fully encapsulated mesh, suspended and carefully contoured to the shapes of the mask, to allow for superior performance and longevity.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Experience comes with practice, which we have plenty of because we have been in the game longer than anyone else. Our highly trained artists and technicians consider every detail so a mask works in any environment. Whether the mask is for a film, haunt attraction, stage show, theme park, convention, or Halloween, it will perform like a dream.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Our designers revel in crafting masks of horror and realism and work to bring you the stuff of nightmares daily. Pair that enthusiasm with years of research and carefully selected materials, and you get master craftsmanship. The end result for you is masks that perform flawlessly and look fantastic.</p>
			<br>
			<p>There is no need to worry about the fit or look because all of our masks and props are engineered for scale and optimal anatomical placement. The masks will mold to your features so well that each of your refined movements will be translated and expressed to show the exact emotion you want in the mask of your choice. The props will convince anyone you have the real deal.</p>
